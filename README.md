A small Classic Arcade Game project where you as a player would stand at one end and the goal is to reach the other end without getting infested by bugs roaming in between.

## Motivation

The major part of motivation to develop this project comes from Udacity for this is part of an exercise in their Front End Development nanodegree course.

## Instructions

Use this [GIT HUB](https://github.com/sivakrajgithub/fend3-memory-arcade-game) link to checkout the game to your local machine. 

The game is still not hosted yet to directly play in the browser by pointing to URL. So bear with me for a while until it gets hosted.

#### How to run the game?

Click on this [GIT HUB](https://github.com/sivakrajgithub/fend3-memory-arcade-game) link and find the button _Clone or download_ at the right end of the GIT HUB page to download this project as zip file.

Once downloaded, unzip the package and feel free to keep the unzipped folder in any location of your machine as you like.

Now the final step, navigate into the unzipped folder and locate the _index.html_. Game can be started either by double-clicking _index.html_ or opening in your favorite browser using _context menu_ or from the browser's _File_ menu -> _Open_.

If you followed the instructions correctly then the browser presents you with a screen where you'd find a game arena with player at one end and bugs randomly crossing your path to the other end.

#### How to play?

You need only four keys to play this game: 

- _Up_ arrow key
- _Down_ arrow key
- _Right_ arrow key
- _Left_ arrow key

Once you run this game in your favorite browser, navigate the player using the aforementioned four keys. The corresponding movement of the player for the keys is self-explanatory.

Either you're hit by the bugs on your path or you reach the other end safely, you'll be presented with a popup confirming success or failure.
